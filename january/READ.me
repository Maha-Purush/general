Thsi text file contains written/typed proof that from the ownder of this repository (Balaji Kamat) that
most of the codes for January are contained within the Arrays folder of the [neetcode-practice] repository.
Which is the reason why there's way less codes in the [January] folder of this repository as compared to folders of the
other months.
